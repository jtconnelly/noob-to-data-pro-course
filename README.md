# noob-to-data-pro-course

Course for my friend to teach him the basics of python and then showing how to
use python for data gathering and manipulation.

## How to use
1. Pull the github repository down into a local folder.
2. Navigate to `courses/html` and open the `TableOfContents.html` and have fun
learning!  3. For anything that might require direct download or is referenced
within the project-whether a photograph, a class, or a dataset-look under
`courses/data`

Note: For interactive sections, the folder `answers` will work as an answer key
for reference.
